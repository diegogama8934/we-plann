### Folder structure


## Components

This folder is dedicated to have all components that will be used in the Application.

> There is an index.ts file that is dedicated to export all the Components of the folder, in order to import all the components from this file when we need someone in the pages or other components.

- Core Components

  Core Components are dedicated to show and have the logic of the ui of the application itself. Core components donÂ´t have to be rendered in landing page, for example, because they are dedicated to build the UI of the core aplication.

- Presentation Components

  Presentation Components are dedicated to show and have the logic of the onboarding section of the product, this must include the components of login and signup.

- Tremor Chart

  For the functional requirements of the products, is needed to use Charts in order to show data in a comfortable UI view. So the project will use Tremor Charts to show that data. **This folder must not be changed**.

## Hooks

When it is complex logic inside components to handle its behavior, the hooks folder can wrap the logic and export it to the component in order to keep the components reading the clearist posible. Some details about the hooks folder.

- Index.ts

  An index.ts file will be a direct child of the hooks folder. This file is the responsible to export all the hooks inside the folder. The reason of this is to keep the imporatation in the components only to one place (the index.ts)

- useOnWindowResize.ts

  This file is used by Tremor Chart to work itself. **This file must not be deleted or modified**
